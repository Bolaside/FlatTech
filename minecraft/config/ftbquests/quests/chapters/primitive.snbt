You can also pause machines after one recipe runs if you sneak while right clicking - this is more useful for multiblocks as it won't consume the items for the next recipe cycle."
				"- File: only a crafting tool, that's it."
				"- Saw: also not used for anything but crafting, unlike the &nchain&rsaw."
				"- Wrench: a common crafting tool and is used to rotate blocks and set machine outputs, sneak + right click in the air to change which output it's gonna set: item, fluid, or both."
